This update introduces **preview modes**. With preview modes you can configure different modes for the preview button based on content types or node ids.

Maybe you have some content nodes that are not a page with a URL on your website, with preview modes you can remove the preview button for these nodes. Or maybe you have an Umbraco installtion with multiple sites and some of the sites are build as headless sites with headless preview and some of the sites are running as standard sites with standard Umbraco preview, this is now also possible.

It's also now possible to disable the headless preview functionallity for the entire Umbraco installation.

## Added
- Preview modes based on content type or node ids (UseHeadlessPreview, UseStandardPreview, DisablePreview)
- Appsettings.json schema file to provide IntelliSense when configuring the HeadlessPreview settings in the appsettings.json file
